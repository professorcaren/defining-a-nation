    title: "August 1905 — Simla",
    text: `The monsoon clouds hang heavy over the Viceregal Lodge. You've served as private secretary to Lord Curzon for eighteen months now, long enough to read the particular tension in his jawline as he slides a leather portfolio across the mahogany desk.

"The Partition will be announced within weeks," he says. "Bengal is unwieldy—78 million souls, impossible to govern effectively. We're creating two provinces: a Muslim-majority east with its capital at Dacca, and a Hindu-majority west centered on Calcutta."

On paper, it's administrative reform. The files cite population density, revenue collection challenges, the difficulty of managing such vast territory.

But you've read the intelligence reports. You know what the Bengali press is saying.`,
    button: "Continue"
  },
  {
    title: "The Calcutta Papers",
    text: `Three newspapers sit before you, each telling a different story:

**The Englishman** (British-owned): "Lord Curzon's masterstroke will bring efficient governance to India's most populous province."

**Amrita Bazar Patrika** (Bengali nationalist): "The Partition is a dagger aimed at Bengali unity—splitting Hindu from Muslim, severing our cultural heartland."

**The Bengalee** (edited by Surendranath Banerjee): "Partition invites profound disappointment, yet our response must remain constitutional—petitions, not bombs."

But there are newer voices too. Younger men—Bipin Chandra Pal, Aurobindo Ghose—speak of *swadeshi* (own-country), of boycotting British goods entirely. Of meeting foreign rule not with petitions, but with resistance.

The question everyone whispers: Is this really about administration? Or is it "divide and rule"?`,
    button: "Continue"
  },
  {
    title: "Your Task",
    text: `Lord Curzon leans back. "The decision is made. London supports it. But implementation—that's where empires are won or lost."

He needs you to manage what comes next. The official announcement. The inevitable protests. The competing factions within the Indian political class—moderates who still believe in petitions and constitutional reform, and extremists who speak openly of driving the British from India.

"You'll have broad discretion," Curzon continues. "Suppress sedition, certainly. But also—consider concessions where prudent. Industrial grants, educational reforms, consultation with loyal elements. We must maintain order without igniting rebellion."

He pauses at the door. "The Partition is administrative necessity. But Bengal is... passionate. Literate. They produce poets and revolutionaries in equal measure. Don't let it become a spark."

The leather folder contains your initial briefing papers. The choices you make in the coming months will shape whether this reform strengthens British India—or begins its unraveling.`,
    button: "Continue"
  },
  {
    title: "Your Goals",
    text: `As the Viceroy's private secretary, you must navigate the crisis of the Bengal Partition. Your decisions will be measured across four key pressures:

**Legitimacy** — Does the British administration maintain credibility with Indian elites and the wider public?

**Local Stability** — Can you prevent the situation from tipping into riots, strikes, or violence?

**Swadeshi Momentum** — The boycott movement is growing. Will you contain it, redirect it, or concede ground?

**Reputation** — In London and Delhi, are you judged a steady hand or a liability to imperial governance?

The game will surface the dilemmas facing colonial administrators: how to project authority without provoking revolt, how to negotiate with moderate nationalists while confronting radicals, and how economic protest became a crucible for Indian self-rule.

History remembers that the Partition was annulled in 1911. Your decisions will show why.`,
    button: "Continue"
  },
  {
    title: "Game Rules",
    text: `Your post lasts only if the Raj believes you can keep Bengal orderly.

You will be **removed from your post** if any of the following happen:
- Legitimacy collapses (value < 20) — your administration loses the confidence of Calcutta and London alike.
- Local Stability collapses (value < 20) — unrest overwhelms your ability to govern.
- Swadeshi Momentum becomes unstoppable (value > 85) — the boycott makes the Partition unworkable.

You will **survive to the end of 1908** if none of those crises occur before the calendar reaches 31 December 1908.

Every turn advances time; every decision shifts the numbers. Choose with care.`,
