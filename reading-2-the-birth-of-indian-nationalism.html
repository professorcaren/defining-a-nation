<h1>Reading 2: The Birth of Indian Nationalism</h1>
<p><em>From the Indian National Congress to Gandhi's Arrival (1885--1919)</em></p>
<p>The first reading explained the India the British conquered. This one explains how Indians began to fight back, and why they could not agree on what they were fighting for. It covers the rise of the Indian National Congress, the emergence of Hindu revivalism and Muslim separatism, and Gandhi's arrival on the political stage. The central tension is between two theories of Indian nationhood: one secular and constitutional, the other rooted in religious identity. That tension will drive every debate at the Simla conference.</p>
<hr />
<h2>British Education and Its Discontents</h2>
<p>British officials established universities and schools across India that would, within a generation, produce the people who challenged British rule. In 1857 the British founded universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras modeled after the University of London. Hundreds of primary and secondary schools followed. Although instruction was usually in regional languages, nearly all included English.</p>
<p>The limited reach of these schools was confirmed by the persistence of illiteracy: according to the 1881 census, 95% of Indians could not read or write any language. But one group seized the opportunity. High-caste Hindus recognized that knowledge of English, British laws, customs, and preferences would open careers in administration, law, and medicine. By the 1880s, an entire class of young Indian men, having learned English and absorbed British culture, were advancing through the lower levels of the civil service. But their ambitions were blocked: only a handful of the 1,000 top administrators were Indian, and none of the army's officers.</p>
<p>For Indian Muslims, the shift was devastating. Persian had been the language of government for centuries. As the British gradually replaced Persian with English in administration after the 1830s, Muslim elites were slow to adapt, often seeing English education as a threat to Islamic learning. Hindu families, with fewer theological reservations, embraced English schools rapidly. The results were stark: by some contemporary estimates, Indian Muslims in parts of North India went from holding a majority of subordinate government posts in the mid-nineteenth century to holding roughly a third by 1913, while Hindus held the majority. The colonial state was increasingly dominated by English-educated Hindus, with consequences for the politics of partition.</p>
<h2>The Rise of the Indian National Congress</h2>
<p>These frustrated, British-educated young Indians inhabited two worlds. They had assimilated to British values but were barred from British power. Their careers depended on British institutions, but those same institutions blocked their advancement.</p>
<p>One such Indian was <strong>Surendranath Banerjea</strong> (1848--1926). His father, a Brahmin doctor, sent him to London to take the civil service exam. Banerjea passed, was assigned as a magistrate in Bengal, one of the first Indians to hold such a position, but was dismissed over a subordinate's clerical error. His appeals were denied. Embittered, he returned to Calcutta and committed his life to "redressing our wrongs and protecting our rights."</p>
<p>In 1885, Indian leaders responded to decades of blocked ambition by organizing the <strong>Indian National Congress (INC)</strong>. Its goal was not to overthrow British rule but to reform it. Early Congress leaders admired British civilization and believed they would ultimately inherit power through constitutional means. Some cited the example of Washington and Jefferson; others referenced Italian nationalists who had unified Italy.</p>

<p>But the Congress faced a problem. Although it claimed to speak for all Indians, its leaders were divorced from the masses. The INC focused on civil service discrimination---issues that mattered little to the peasant whose mud hut had washed away in a storm, or the untouchable who could not access a water well. The leaders' British education, which gave them political sophistication, also ensured their political impotence among ordinary Indians.</p>
<h2>Apostles of Hindu Revival</h2>
<p>The INC's path to nationhood, reforming British rule from within, was now challenged by leaders with a different vision. They did not seek to modernize India on British lines. They sought to revitalize and enshrine Hindu values.</p>
<p><strong>Bankim Chandra Chatterji</strong> (1838--1894), a Bengali civil servant and novelist, wrote fiction celebrating Hindu resistance to foreign rule. His 1882 novel <em>Anandamath</em> featured a poem, the <strong>Vande Mataram</strong> ("I Praise Thee, Mother"), which became the anthem of Indian nationalism. In it, "Mother" invoked the nation as a divine mother figure, Bengal and India sacralized as goddess. The Vande Mataram was sung at the 1896 session of the Indian National Congress and became the anthem of the independence movement, but its explicitly Hindu imagery would later alienate Muslims.</p>
<p><strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak</strong> (1856--1920), working among Marathi-speaking Hindus near Bombay, celebrated the Maratha warrior Shivaji, who had carved out a Hindu empire from the declining Mughal dynasty. Tilak proposed new annual festivals dedicated to the Hindu god Ganesh and to Shivaji. When a plague struck, Tilak denounced British anti-plague measures and cited the Bhagavad Gita as justification for resistance. British authorities blamed Tilak's writings for inflaming the atmosphere; when two Hindu teenagers assassinated a British officer shortly afterward, Tilak was convicted of sedition.</p>
<p><strong>Vinayak Savarkar</strong> (1883--1966), a young Brahmin, took a vow before the family deity to drive the British from the Motherland. He founded secret societies throughout western and central India. His later work <em>Hindutva: Who Is a Hindu?</em> insisted that all peoples of the subcontinent shared the core values of Hindu civilization. India's destiny was to become a great Hindu nation: <strong>Hindustan</strong>.</p>
<p>They represented a fundamentally different theory of nationhood: India was Hindu, Hinduism was the means of achieving independence, and a strong Hindu nation would secure that independence.</p>

<h2>The Partition of Bengal and Militant Nationalism</h2>
<p>In 1905, the governor general announced a plan to divide Bengal into two provinces. This made administrative sense, since Bengal had 78 million people, more than the entire United States. But Bengali Hindus saw it as a sinister ploy to fracture the epicenter of Hindu radicalism and create a new province in East Bengal with a Muslim majority.</p>
<p>Nationalists proposed a boycott of all British-manufactured goods. This <strong>swadeshi</strong> movement, driven by Hindu revivalists, economic nationalists, and Congress moderates alike, sought to stem the flow of Indian wealth to Britain. Savarkar proposed collecting heaps of British goods and burning them in public squares. By 1907 the INC was being pulled in two directions: one secular and Western, seeking independence through constitutional reform; the other Hindu and traditionalist, insisting that Indians must seize control by force.</p>
<p>The violence escalated. Two Bengalis threw a bomb intended for a British judge, killing two British women. Savarkar was captured and sentenced to 50 years in prison. The question that would haunt Indian politics for decades was now in the open: <strong>Could the independence movement hold together people who agreed on expelling the British but disagreed on everything else?</strong></p>
<h2>The Muslim League</h2>
<p>The furor over Bengal's partition did not just fracture the INC; it unnerved Muslim leaders. For decades, educated Muslims had followed <strong>Syed Ahmad Khan</strong> (1817--1898), who urged Muslims to endorse British rule. If the British were driven from India, Khan warned, the overwhelming Hindu majority would impose their religion and culture upon Muslims.</p>
<p>By 1906, Khan's warnings resonated with new force. Wealthy Muslims formed the <strong>All-India Muslim League</strong> to defend Muslim interests and promote "feelings of loyalty to the British government." British officials, appreciative of Muslim support, agreed to <strong>"reserve" seats</strong> in legislative councils for Muslims and, crucially, to allow Muslims to vote in <strong>separate electorates</strong>, where only Muslims could vote for Muslim candidates. This infuriated the INC, which saw separate electorates as a British strategy to institutionalize communal divisions.</p>
<h2>The Making of Muslim India</h2>
<p>The British decision to codify separate electorates had consequences beyond its immediate politics. Colonial administration had already been reshaping Muslim identity for over a century. The census forced every Indian to declare a fixed religious affiliation, sharpening boundaries between communities that had historically been more fluid. The codification of Islamic law gave Muslim personal law a more conservative, scriptural character than what most Muslims actually practiced. And the decline of Persian as the language of government cut educated Muslims off from the state apparatus they had once dominated. The cumulative effect was to make Indian Muslims feel, and be treated as, a separate community, distinct from their Hindu neighbors in ways that were increasingly institutionalized.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, within Islam itself, the trauma of lost sovereignty sparked a major reform movement. After the British crushed the 1857 uprising and desecrated mosques in Delhi, displaced Muslim scholars founded the <strong>Deoband seminary</strong> in 1867. Cut off from state patronage for the first time in centuries, the Deobandi clerics turned to grassroots preaching and printed pamphlets to reach ordinary Muslims. They sought greater scriptural rigor, critiquing certain popular practices, such as elaborate shrine worship and gift-giving to holy men, that they considered insufficiently grounded in the Quran and Hadith. The Deobandi movement made Indian Muslims, more self-consciously Muslim than they had been under Mughal rule.</p>
<h2>World War I</h2>
<p>In 1914, all of Europe was plunged into the Great War. Most INC leaders endorsed the British war effort, reasoning that by helping Britain in its hour of need, Britain would reciprocate by transferring power after the war. Nearly a million Indians fought for Great Britain, seeing action in the Middle East, North Africa, and France.</p>
<p>Not all Indians supported the war. <strong>M. N. Roy</strong> (1887--1954), drawn first to revolutionary nationalist networks and then to communist revolution, conspired with German agents to smuggle guns to Indian revolutionaries. He eventually fled to Mexico and became embroiled in theoretical disputes with Lenin and Stalin over revolutionary strategy.</p>
<p>The Hindu radical Savarkar, imprisoned in the Andaman Islands, was delighted that Indians were volunteering to fight: "Thank God! Manliness after all is not dead yet in the land." For Savarkar, military service, even for Britain, built the martial spirit a future Hindu nation would need.</p>
<h2>Enter Gandhi</h2>
<p><strong>Mohandas Gandhi</strong> (1868--1948) was born into a merchant caste in Gujarat. His parents sent him to local English-style schools and arranged his marriage at thirteen. When his father died, relatives sent him to study law in London.</p>
<p>Gandhi's time in London transformed him. He initially tried to assimilate, wearing a silk hat, taking dancing lessons, carrying a silver-mounted walking stick. But he could not stomach English food. He gravitated to vegetarian circles and rediscovered Hindu texts, viewing English society with growing skepticism.</p>
<p>In 1891 he passed the bar and returned to India, but failed to establish a law practice. He eventually found work defending Indian rights in South Africa, where he spent two decades (1893--1914) as a political organizer against South Africa's racially discriminatory colonial regime.</p>
<p>Gandhi was transformed. He repudiated Western materialism: the steel mills of Manchester, the oppressive conditions of industrial work, the hopelessness of urban tenements. He embraced the life of the simple Indian peasant, going barefoot and wearing handspun cloth (<em>khadi</em>).</p>
<p>He also developed his philosophy of <strong>nonviolent resistance</strong>. He urged oppressed peoples to pursue justice through civil disobedience, a strategy he called <strong>satyagraha</strong> ("truth force"). The way people achieved justice, he insisted, inevitably shaped the results. Those who resorted to violence were corrupted by it; those animated by truth ultimately prevailed.</p>
<p>His political genius lay in refusing to separate morality from politics. The British treated them as separate domains; Gandhi insisted they were inseparable. <strong>Ahimsa</strong> (nonviolence) was not passivity but a weapon. If people refused to respond with violence when attacked, they exposed the authorities as bullies and proved that all political systems ultimately require the consent of those they govern. Combined with satyagraha, the insistence that truth itself was a force, ahimsa became, in Gandhi's words, "a sword which spills no blood."</p>
<p>Gandhi also forged alliances across religious lines. He befriended <strong>Abul Kalam Azad</strong> (1888--1958), an Islamic scholar who insisted that Islam and Hinduism shared fundamental truths. He worked with <strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong>, a Bombay lawyer who belonged to both Congress and the Muslim League and who, in 1916, brokered the <strong>Lucknow Pact</strong>, an agreement between Congress and the League on reserved seats for Muslims in provincial legislatures. For a brief moment, Hindu-Muslim unity seemed possible.</p>
<p>By 1915, Gandhi was the <strong>Mahatma</strong>---"the great soul." He had not yet led a mass movement. But he had developed the ideas and the authority to lead one.</p>
<h2>The Amritsar Massacre (1919)</h2>
<p>On November 11, 1918, the armistice ended the Great War. Indian leaders expected independence, or at least major concessions, as a reward for their loyalty. Instead, Britain passed the <strong>Rowlatt Acts</strong>, repressive laws giving the government power to arrest suspects without warrant, imprison them without trial, and try them without juries.</p>
<p>Gandhi called the Rowlatt Acts "a striking demonstration of the determination of the Civil Service to retain its grip of our necks." He called for a general strike, a <strong>satyagraha</strong> campaign. Indians should stay home from work and school, pray, fast, and attend political meetings.</p>
<p>But in <strong>Amritsar</strong>, the largest city in the Punjab, protests turned violent and four Europeans were killed. Britain imposed martial law. When a crowd of unarmed civilians gathered peacefully in the <strong>Jallianwala Bagh</strong>, a walled public garden, British General Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to open fire. They killed 400 and wounded over 1,000, women and children included.</p>
<p>Gandhi cancelled the remainder of the satyagraha, calling it a "Himalayan miscalculation." The masses had not yet absorbed the discipline of nonviolence.</p>

<p>But the Amritsar massacre transformed Indian politics. It proved what Gandhi had argued: British rule rested ultimately on violence. General Dyer said the massacre was intended as "a moral signal to India," a statement that confirmed every Indian's worst fears about the nature of the Raj. When Dyer was forced to resign but received a hero's welcome and a £30,000 prize upon returning to England, the message was clear.</p>
<p>Gandhi saw Dyer as a rotten apple, but the Raj as the rotten orchard. The scales had tipped. The question was no longer whether India would seek independence, but how, and what kind of nation it would become.</p>
