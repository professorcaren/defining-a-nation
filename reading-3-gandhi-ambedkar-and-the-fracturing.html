<h1>Reading 3: Gandhi, Ambedkar, and the Fracturing</h1>
<p><em>From Non-Cooperation to the Eve of Simla (1920--1945)</em></p>
<p>The first two readings brought you to 1919: a subcontinent under British rule, with competing visions of independence just beginning to take shape. This reading covers the quarter-century that shattered any hope of easy agreement. Gandhi's campaigns mobilized millions but could not hold them together. Ambedkar forced the question of caste onto the national agenda. Jinnah made the case for Pakistan. By 1945, every faction at Simla had reason to distrust every other. Understanding how that happened is essential to playing your role.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Non-Cooperation</h2>
<p>After the Amritsar massacre, Gandhi proposed a new strategy: <strong>non-cooperation</strong>. Indians should boycott foreign goods, withdraw children from schools, and refuse to participate in legislative elections. He encouraged Indians to spin their own cloth. "Love of foreign cloth," Gandhi declared, "brought foreign domination, pauperism and what is worse, shame to many a home." The simple white cap made of homespun cloth (<em>khadi</em>), the "Gandhi cap," became the symbol of the nationalist cause.</p>
<p>In 1921 Gandhi traveled throughout India, including long walks to remote villages. His challenge to British rule electrified the country but also inflamed tensions. Riots erupted in Bombay and elsewhere. Congress leaders sought to intensify the campaign, and in early 1922 Gandhi endorsed the next step: non-violent civil disobedience, including refusal to pay taxes.</p>
<p>A few days later, in the town of <strong>Chauri Chaura</strong>, rioters surrounded a police station and set it ablaze, killing 22 officers. Gandhi was devastated. "God spoke clearly through Chauri Chaura," he said. "He has warned me that there is not yet in India that non-violent and truthful atmosphere which alone can justify mass civil disobedience."</p>
<p>He called off the entire campaign. Congress leaders were furious. Muslim allies felt betrayed. They had staked their credibility on the movement. The British arrested Gandhi on charges of sedition. He spent two years in prison.</p>
<p>But Gandhi had achieved what no Indian leader had: he mobilized millions of ordinary Indians into political action. His most surprising convert was <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru</strong> (1889--1964), the Cambridge-educated son of a wealthy Congress lawyer. Nehru was drawn to Marxism and applauded the Bolshevik revolution. But he gravitated to Gandhi because the Mahatma, uniquely able to mobilize mass participation, could enlist popular support in ways that no Western-educated intellectual ever could.</p>
<h2>Hindu Nationalist Mobilization</h2>
<p>One major consequence of Gandhi's campaign was the resurgence of <strong>Hindu nationalism</strong>. Once mobilized for political action, many Hindus joined the <strong>Hindu Mahasabha</strong>, which championed Hindu values and practices. <strong>Savarkar</strong>, released from imprisonment in the early 1920s and later active in Hindu nationalist politics, became president of the Mahasabha in 1937. His <em>Hindutva: Who Is a Hindu?</em> (1923) insisted that all peoples of India shared the core values of Hindu civilization. India's destiny was to become <strong>Hindustan</strong>, a great Hindu nation.</p>
<p>The Mahasabha and the <strong>RSS</strong> (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, founded 1925), separate organizations that often overlapped in personnel and outlook, could mobilize large numbers of followers on short notice. Unlike Gandhi, they rejected nonviolence. Unlike Congress secularists like Nehru, they insisted that India's identity was fundamentally Hindu. They competed with Congress for Hindu loyalty, arguing that Congress's secularism was a betrayal.</p>
<h2>Iqbal and the Muslim Resurgence</h2>
<p>Muslims were alarmed. Their earlier hope that constitutional structures could protect the Muslim minority now seemed naive. What would happen to Muslims in a nation dominated by Savarkar and the Hindu Mahasabha?</p>
<p>The answer came from <strong>Muhammad Iqbal</strong> (1873--1938), a poet and philosopher educated at Cambridge and in Germany. Iqbal wrote mostly in Urdu and Persian, which he saw as a way of addressing the problems confronting India's Muslims. He emphasized the importance of the Muslim community, "the single bond" that grew out of shared faith. Indian politics had become a welter of "dismembered tribes," each at odds with the other. Any attempt to stitch these remnants into a single nation would fail.</p>
<p>In 1930, in a major address to the Muslim League, Iqbal declared that the peoples of India were defined by their religious communities, and each required its own state. "The construction of a polity on national lines, if it means a displacement of Islamic principles of solidarity, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim." Muslims must be given a homeland, most likely in the northwestern provinces where they comprised a majority.</p>
<p><strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong>, who had once belonged to both Congress and the League and had brokered Hindu-Muslim unity at Lucknow in 1916, now endorsed Iqbal's vision. Jinnah argued that Muslims were a distinct political community whose interests could not be secured in a Hindu-majority democracy. They must have their own state.</p>
<p>The shift in Muslim politics was shaped by more than ideology. During the interwar years, the Muslim League had largely stayed aloof from Congress's mass campaigns. This had a practical consequence: the League learned far less about governing and administration than Congress did. But it also meant the League was positioned differently with the British, who saw Jinnah as more reasonable, or at least less threatening, than Gandhi. The League used the years of Congress's absence from provincial government to build support among Muslims in Bengal, the Punjab, and Sindh, precisely the provinces where any future Pakistan would be carved.</p>
<h2>Gandhi and the Salt March (1930)</h2>
<p>During the 1930s, communal riots between Muslim and Hindu communities erupted frequently. Communist revolutionaries incited unrest among peasants and workers. The Great Depression struck India, worsening poverty.</p>
<p>Gandhi launched a new civil disobedience campaign, targeting the British monopoly on salt, an essential commodity in such a hot land. He walked 240 miles from Ahmedabad to the salt flats at Dandi on the Arabian coast. <strong>Nehru</strong>, one of the marchers, would never forget the sight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw him marching staff in hand... Here was a pilgrim on his quest of Truth, quiet, peaceful, determined and fearless, who would continue that quest and pilgrimage regardless of consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four weeks later, Gandhi arrived at Dandi with thousands of followers. He scooped up a handful of mud and salt and gave it away in defiance of British law. Protests erupted across India. Gandhi and 50,000 supporters were arrested.</p>
<p>The salt march drew millions into political action but failed to end British rule, or even the salt tax. Critics attacked from all sides. The communist <strong>M. N. Roy</strong> denounced Gandhian nonviolence as "a subtle intellectual device for concealing the capitalist exploitation of the country." The Hindu nationalist <strong>Savarkar</strong> scoffed: "We denounce the doctrine of absolute non-violence not because we are less saintly, but because we are more sensible." Even mainstream Congress leaders, many of whom ended up in prison, were perplexed. Gandhi had shaken the foundations of the British empire. But the empire still stood.</p>
<h2>The "Problem" of the Untouchables</h2>
<p>Another question complicated matters: What was to be done about India's 70 million Untouchables?</p>
<p><strong>B. R. Ambedkar</strong> (1891--1956) was himself an Untouchable whose father had served in the British military. As a boy, he could not sit at desks with other students but was obliged to sit on the floor. Other children refused to come near him. His teachers would not touch his notebook. One kind teacher offered him special instruction and food; his name was Ambedkar, a name Bhimrao added to his own. Eventually, a local prince arranged for him to attend Columbia University in New York, where he earned a PhD in economics.</p>
<p>Ambedkar argued that constitutional promises of equality were worthless without the political power to enforce them. The British had protected the Muslim minority by reserving seats and creating separate electorates; they should do the same for Untouchables. In 1932, the viceroy agreed to reserve 71 seats in provincial legislatures for Untouchables, with <strong>separate electorates</strong>: Untouchable voters would choose their own representatives in a separate ballot, preventing the Hindu majority from electing compliant Untouchable candidates.</p>
<p>Gandhi was outraged. He had long championed the rights of Untouchables, whom he called <strong>Harijans</strong> ("children of God," a term many Untouchables considered patronizing). But he opposed separate electorates absolutely. Untouchables should not be set apart from Indian society but integrated within it. Separate electorates were a British strategy of "divide and rule" that would permanently fracture the Hindu community.</p>
<p>Gandhi announced he would <strong>fast unto death</strong> if Britain did not withdraw the plan.</p>
<p>As Gandhi's fast continued, Ambedkar was subjected to a firestorm. Congress editors denounced him as a monster and potential murderer. He had little choice but to withdraw his demand. The result was the <strong>Poona Pact</strong> (1932): Untouchables would receive more reserved seats than originally planned, but in <strong>joint electorates</strong>, meaning all voters, including caste Hindus, would choose who filled those seats. Ambedkar considered this a devastating defeat. Gandhi had used his moral authority to silence the most oppressed group in India.</p>
<p>Ambedkar, furious, would spend the next decade building the case that Congress and Gandhi did not speak for Untouchables. The question of reserved seats versus separate electorates, the technical distinction at the heart of the Poona Pact, would resurface at Simla with explosive force.</p>
<h2>The Government of India Act (1935)</h2>
<p>The salt march forced Britain to make further concessions. The <strong>Government of India Act (1935)</strong> provided for elected provincial legislatures, expanded voting rights (including to women), and reserved seats for minorities. Provincial assemblies included reserved seats for groups such as Depressed Classes (Untouchables), Muslims, Christians, and tribal peoples, alongside "general" seats open to all, which in practice were dominated by caste Hindus.</p>
<p>Congress criticized the act for treating India as "an agglomeration of peoples rather than as a unified, emerging nation." But Congress ran candidates anyway, and won legislative majorities in seven of eleven provinces.</p>
<p>The results terrified the Muslim League, which fared poorly even in Muslim-majority provinces. Worse, when Congress ministers took power, some provincial governments promoted Hindu symbols: flying the Congress flag, singing the Bandemataram, endorsing Hindu educational schemes. Even seemingly minor decisions about school textbooks proved explosive. Bengali Muslims were outraged when new texts included a Hindu goddess as a synonym for God.</p>
<p>These disputes confirmed Jinnah's fears. In March 1940, the Muslim League endorsed the <strong>Lahore Resolution</strong>, calling for "independent states" in the Muslim-majority zones of the northwest and east, what would eventually be called <strong>Pakistan</strong>.</p>
<h2>World War II and Quit India</h2>
<p>By 1940, Britain was at war with Hitler's Germany. Congress offered to support the war effort in exchange for an immediate commitment to independence. The viceroy refused. Congress ministers resigned from their provincial governments in protest. The Muslim League seized the opportunity, expanding its organizational base and building support in provinces where Congress was now absent.</p>
<p>In 1942, with Japan threatening to invade from the east, Churchill dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps to offer a new postwar constitution. The Cripps proposal would establish an Indian union within the British Dominion after the war, but allowed any province or princely state to remain outside the union. Congress rejected the offer. They would not support Britain in exchange for a mere promise, especially one that conceded the possibility of partition. Gandhi called it "a post-dated check on a crashing bank."</p>
<p>On August 8, 1942, Congress passed the <strong>"Quit India" resolution</strong>, demanding Britain's immediate withdrawal. "We shall either free India or die in the attempt," Gandhi declared.</p>
<p>Within hours, the British arrested Gandhi and every major Congress leader. What followed was the worst challenge to British rule since 1857. Students rioted. Protesters attacked railway stations, post offices, and government buildings. Rail lines were sabotaged, telegraph lines cut, and government property attacked. Britain imposed martial law. The Quit India movement was crushed within months, but at enormous cost to British prestige. Many British administrators grew tired of the repression. Even the viceroy admitted that British prestige was "running on empty."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who did not join Quit India used the moment to build their own power:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Communist Party</strong>, aligned with the Soviet line, supported the British war effort against fascism, earning the contempt of nationalists</li>
<li>The <strong>Muslim League</strong> took positions in provincial governments vacated by Congress, building organizational strength in Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh</li>
<li><strong>Ambedkar</strong> accepted a position on the Executive Council of the British Governor General, advancing Untouchable interests while Congress leaders sat in prison</li>
<li>The <strong>princes</strong> of Hyderabad and Kashmir supported Britain to cement their postwar positions</li>
<li><strong>Hindu nationalist</strong> organizations like the Mahasabha and RSS stayed aloof from Quit India, quietly building grassroots networks</li>
</ul>
<p>The war devastated India's economy. Britain marshaled Indian resources for the war effort at unprecedented levels. Wartime inflation skyrocketed. The <strong>Bengal famine of 1943</strong> killed millions (often estimated around 3 million), not from natural causes alone, but from the wartime disruption of food supplies, British negligence, and the prioritization of military needs over civilian survival.</p>
<h2>The Eve of Simla</h2>
<p>By mid-1945, Germany had surrendered and Japan was collapsing. Britain, though victorious, was exhausted: its economy shattered, its people weary, its treasury depleted.</p>
<p>In June 1945, the viceroy released the imprisoned Congress leaders and announced a conference at Simla to determine India's future. Every faction arrived with a different vision:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Congress</strong> claimed to speak for all Indians and demanded a unified, independent India</li>
<li>The <strong>Muslim League</strong> demanded Pakistan</li>
<li><strong>Gandhi's followers</strong> envisioned village self-governance and nonviolence</li>
<li><strong>Ambedkar</strong> demanded guaranteed political power for Untouchables</li>
<li>The <strong>Sikhs</strong> feared absorption into either a Hindu India or a Muslim Pakistan</li>
<li>The <strong>Hindu Mahasabha</strong> demanded a Hindu nation</li>
<li>The <strong>Communists</strong> sought revolutionary transformation</li>
<li>The <strong>princes</strong> claimed legal independence</li>
<li>The <strong>British</strong> had to decide how to hand over power without triggering the communal bloodbath everyone feared</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gandhi-Jinnah talks of 1944 had already failed. Gandhi insisted India must remain one nation. Jinnah declared it contained two.</p>
<p>Now the leaders are arriving at Simla. The stakes could not be higher. If they succeed, a new nation, or nations, will be born. If they fail, India may descend into the communal violence that has been smoldering for decades.</p>
