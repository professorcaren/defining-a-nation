<h1>Reading 1: What Is India?</h1>
<p><em>From the Mughals through the British Conquest</em></p>
<p>Before you can understand the 1945 debates at Simla, you need to understand the India those delegates inherited. This reading covers the subcontinent's geography, the Mughal Empire and its fragmentation, the rise of the East India Company, and the structure of British rule. Pay attention to two recurring patterns: the gap between formal authority and actual power on the ground, and the way religious identity became entangled with political control, not because Hindus and Muslims were always in conflict, but because successive rulers found it useful to govern through communal categories.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Land</h2>
<p>India is a subcontinent the size of Europe, home to hundreds of millions of people who speak dozens of languages, practice several major religions, and inhabit landscapes ranging from Himalayan peaks to tropical coastline. Where people live shapes what they grow, whom they trade with, and who rules them.</p>
<p>The <strong>Gangetic Plain</strong> stretches across northern India, one of the most fertile regions on earth. Watered by the Ganges River descending from the Himalayas, it has sustained dense populations and powerful empires for millennia. This is one of the historic centers of Hindu civilization.</p>
<p>To the east lies <strong>Bengal</strong>, centered on the vast Ganges delta and the great port city of Calcutta. Bengal's waterways connect it to Southeast Asia and the wider maritime world. Its wealth made it the first target of European merchants---and the first region of India to fall under British rule.</p>
<p>The <strong>Deccan Plateau</strong> covers the peninsular interior, largely dry, with mountains that historically prevented northern conquerors from subduing the south.</p>
<p>In the northwest, the <strong>Punjab</strong> (from the Persian for "five waters") is watered by five tributaries flowing from the Himalayas into the Indus River. Its rich farmland makes it India's breadbasket. It is home to large Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh populations---a mix that will become explosive. Beyond the Punjab lies the <strong>Khyber Pass</strong>, the narrow mountain route connecting India to Afghanistan and Central Asia, the traditional highway for invading armies.</p>

<h2>The Mughal Empire</h2>
<p>For centuries before the British arrived, India was not one country but many. During the 1500s and 1600s, the <strong>Mughal dynasty</strong>, Muslim rulers of Central Asian descent, governed much of the subcontinent, reaching a peak under <strong>Akbar the Great</strong> (1556--1605). The Mughals built one of the wealthiest empires in the world. But even at its height, the emperor's authority was limited. In the capital and major cities, officials enforced decrees and collected taxes. In most of the empire, the emperor delegated authority to relatives, chiefs, and local leaders.</p>
<p>Day-to-day authority rested with powerful local <strong>zamindars</strong> (landowners). They professed loyalty to the Mughal dynasty and periodically forwarded tribute, but otherwise ruled as they saw fit. When crops failed or emperors appeared weak, ambitious zamindars kept the taxes for themselves.</p>
<p>The Mughal period established patterns that would persist long after the empire itself collapsed. <strong>Persian</strong> became the language of government and high culture across northern India, used by Hindu administrators as readily as by Muslim rulers. Hindus and Muslims shared regional cultures, languages, and even some spiritual practices. The boundaries between religious communities were more porous than later politics would suggest.</p>
<h3>Religion and Social Order</h3>
<p>To understand the society the Mughals governed, two features require explanation: the Hindu caste system and the place of Islam in India.</p>
<p><strong>Hinduism</strong> is one of the world's oldest religious traditions. It has no single founder, no single holy book, and no central authority. Many strands of Hindu practice recognize one ultimate divine reality expressed through many gods and goddesses. Three concepts are essential for understanding how Hinduism shapes Indian social life. <strong>Dharma</strong> is one's duty: what one is required to do based on birth, family, and station in life. <strong>Karma</strong> is the law of cause and effect---every action has consequences, if not in this life, then in the next. <strong>Samsara</strong> is the cycle of death and rebirth: the soul passes through countless lives, ascending or descending based on karma, until it achieves liberation.</p>
<p>These beliefs underpin the <strong>caste system</strong>, a hierarchical social order rooted in Hindu scripture. The Sanskrit term <strong>varna</strong> divides society into four ranks: <strong>Brahmins</strong> (priests), <strong>Kshatriyas</strong> (warriors and rulers), <strong>Vaishyas</strong> (merchants and traders), and <strong>Shudras</strong> (servants and laborers). Below all four are the <strong>Untouchables</strong> (also called <strong>Dalits</strong>)---considered ritually polluted, historically excluded from temples, wells, and schools. Within each varna are thousands of <strong>jatis</strong>, subdivisions based on birth, occupation, and region. Jati is the most commonly referenced marker of identity in daily Indian life. Karma and dharma provide the cosmological logic for this hierarchy: fulfill your dharma faithfully and you may be reborn into a higher caste; fail, and you descend.</p>
<p><strong>Islam</strong> arrived in India through Arab traders as early as the 7th century and through military conquest beginning in the 11th century. Many of India's Muslims are descendants of converts over the centuries, some drawn by Islam's egalitarian teachings, others incorporated through Sufi networks, elite patronage, or regional political change. Islam's rejection of caste hierarchy offered a powerful alternative to the varna system---though Indian Muslims developed their own informal hierarchy based on claimed descent from the Prophet, from Arab and Persian conquerors, or from more recent Indian converts.</p>
<p>Under Mughal rule, Hindu and Muslim elites shared power. But this coexistence rested on political arrangements, not on resolved theological differences. When those political arrangements collapsed, religious identity would become the fault line of Indian politics.</p>
<h3>The Empire Fragments</h3>
<p>By the late 1600s and early 1700s, the Mughal Empire was breaking apart. Afghan and Persian kings repeatedly invaded northern India. Within India, ambitious zamindars founded their own kingdoms. Large clans and religious communities took control of vast regions: the <strong>Sikhs</strong> in the Punjab, the <strong>Rajputs</strong> in Rajasthan, the <strong>Marathas</strong> in the Deccan. This was not simply the "decline" of the Mughal Empire but its <strong>regionalization</strong>: provinces like Bengal, Hyderabad, and the Punjab became effectively independent kingdoms, each with its own administration, army, and tax system.</p>
<p>This fragmentation created the conditions for British takeover.</p>
<h2>The British East India Company</h2>
<p>As rival warlords were carving up the Mughal empire, a potent new force appeared at Indian ports. During the late 1600s, European merchants arrived to trade silver and copper for Asian spices, silks, tea, and saltpeter. The profits were enormous. The foremost enterprise was the <strong>British East India Company</strong>, chartered by the crown.</p>
<p>The East India Company was not a government; it was a private, profit-driven corporation with its own army. This marriage of private enterprise and state power was a distinguishing feature of British imperialism. The Company swiftly expanded its landholdings beyond docks and warehouses, buying land outright, making loans to Indian princes who used land as security, and seizing that land when loans went unpaid. When princes resisted, the Company's soldiers reduced their fortifications to rubble.</p>
<p>Indian capitalists played an active role in enabling British power. Wealthy Hindu and Jain merchant-banking families bankrolled regional kingdoms and, when those kingdoms proved unstable, shifted their support to the more reliable British. The withdrawal of Indian financiers from regional courts created what one historian calls a "recipe for colonialism."</p>
<p>By 1757 the Company had seized much of Bengal. By 1800, much of southern India had fallen. In the 1840s the British defeated the Sikhs and acquired the Punjab, completing Company domination of the subcontinent.</p>

<h2>The Sepoy Mutiny (1857)</h2>
<p>The East India Company employed Englishmen as officers but found it cheaper to hire and train Indian soldiers ("sepoys"). Often British officers scorned Indian religious beliefs. This proved disastrous in 1857, when officers introduced the new Enfield rifle. Indian soldiers learned that the gun cartridges, which had to be bitten open, had been greased with animal fat, an outrage to Hindus, who regard beef as sacred, and Muslims, who consider pork vile.</p>
<p>Thousands of sepoys mutinied. In Delhi, the last Mughal emperor called on all Indians to overthrow the British. Rebel forces seized Delhi, Lucknow, and other cities. But the rebellion exposed the same problem that would haunt Indian politics for the next century: <strong>the rebels could not agree on what they were fighting for</strong>. Were they restoring the Mughal empire? Defending Hindu kingdoms? Simply expelling the foreigners? The rebellion failed partly because its participants had no shared vision of the future.</p>
<p>The British, augmented by loyal Sikh soldiers, crushed the rebellion with severe reprisals. In its wake, the British government dissolved the East India Company and decided to rule India directly as a colony of the crown. Queen Victoria became Empress of India, but real authority was wielded by the <strong>governor general</strong> (viceroy), whose powers were nearly absolute.</p>
<h2>The British Raj</h2>
<h3>The Political Structure</h3>
<p>The governor general directly ruled two-thirds of India, divided into provinces: the United Provinces, Bihar, Bengal, Madras, Punjab, the Central Provinces, and Bombay. Each province was further subdivided into districts, roughly one for every million inhabitants, each governed by a British administrator.</p>
<p>The actual work of running the colony fell to the <strong>Indian Civil Service</strong>, which in 1880 consisted of about 1,000 senior members, nearly all British. But this structure was too thin to touch most Indians' lives. Many villagers had never seen a British official. For them, authority rested with local zamindars and Brahmin religious leaders.</p>

<h3>The Economic Devastation</h3>
<p>The governor general's main task was to ensure the colony's profitability. Roughly one-third of the colonial budget went to the army, one-quarter to administrative salaries, and 15 percent to debt payments---leaving almost nothing for education, public health, or development.</p>
<p>The economic transformation under British rule was devastating. India in the 1700s was one of the world's great manufacturing economies, producing finished textiles that were coveted across Europe and Asia. Within two generations of British rule, this was reversed: India exported raw cotton and imported British-made cloth. Indian weavers, once among the most skilled artisans in the world, were ruined. Famines, worsened by the commercialization of agriculture and British refusal to intervene in markets, killed 15 to 20 million people by 1900. This economic destruction---the deliberate deindustrialization of a once-wealthy society---is essential context for understanding why every faction at the 1945 Simla conference, whatever else they disagreed on, wanted the British out.</p>
<h3>Caste under the Raj</h3>
<p>British rule also transformed the caste system. Before the British arrived, caste varied enormously by region and was more fluid than later codifications suggest. The British, seeking to govern efficiently, asked Brahmin scholars to define Hindu law. Those scholars produced a version that was more scriptural, more hierarchical, and more Brahmin-centered than what most Indians actually practiced. The British then put this version into law. They also conducted censuses starting in 1871 that required every Hindu to declare a fixed caste identity---creating a permanent bureaucratic category where a more flexible social practice had existed. The cumulative effect was to make caste more rigid and more central to Indian political life than it had ever been.</p>
<h3>The Question of Reform</h3>
<p>British rule provoked debate among Indians themselves about their own traditions. <strong>Ram Mohan Roy</strong> (1772--1833), a Bengali Brahmin and one of the first major Indian intellectuals to engage with Western ideas, argued that practices such as child marriage and <em>sati</em> (the burning of widows on their husbands' funeral pyres) were not essential to Hinduism but superstitious corruptions of its original purity. Roy drew on both Hindu scriptures and Enlightenment philosophy to argue for reform from within. The British banned sati in 1829, partly at Roy's urging, but the broader question he raised, whether India's path forward lay in recovering its own traditions or adopting Western ones, -would never be settled.</p>
<h2>Princely India</h2>
<p>The remaining third of India consisted of some 600 <strong>princely states</strong> whose rulers were hereditary monarchs, mostly Hindu maharajas or Muslim nizams. Some were enormous: Hyderabad had about 15 million people; Kashmir was nearly the size of Montana. Others were tiny.</p>
<p>None of the princes were truly independent. Nearly all governed in "association" with the British. A British official, the "Resident," was assigned to each prince. If the prince failed to keep order or offended British sensibilities, the Resident could invoke legal powers to undermine or remove him.</p>
<p>Two princely states will matter enormously in the debates over India's future: <strong>Hyderabad</strong>, where a Muslim ruler governs a predominantly Hindu population, and <strong>Kashmir</strong>, where a Hindu ruler governs a predominantly Muslim population. Both claim their British treaties guarantee their independence regardless of what happens in the rest of India. Together, they illustrate the problem that makes India's future so difficult: religious identity and political power do not align neatly anywhere on the subcontinent.</p>
